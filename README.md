# PersistenceUniversality

These notebooks generate the figures from the paper "On the Universality of Random Persistence Diagrams."

The notebooks rely on a number of libraries including:

Standard
----------
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- scipy.stats
- statsmodels 

Topological
-----------
- Gudhi
- Ripser
- Diode
(note that only the PD_examples notebook uses these - as it draws the cycles)

The data the notebooks rely on can be found at "Persistence Diagrams for Random Models" (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CNIHYV) in the 
Harvard Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/). Note that this has been tested with download in the original format (as this includes the relevant folder structure).
